          As society enters a hyper-competitive phase in the 21st century, our
          generation is experiencing a historic amount of pressure and
          competition. 
          
          Sometimes we find ourselves asking a seemingly simple yet important question: 
          <br><br>
            <b class = "question">Are we happy? And what makes us happy?</b>

      <b class = "happiness">Happiness</b> is determined differently based on different people and different perspectives. 
    Psychologists define happiness as a feeling of positive emotions of joy, interest, pride, life satisfaction and appreciation of moments. 
    The state of global happiness refers to the state of well-being characterized by emotions ranging from immense contentment to intense joy.
      <br><br><br><br><br>
    However, there are certain factors that contribute to making a happy society. 
    While individually, a person can feel happy receiving a gift, a person can also feel happy if content with their social and working connections. 
    Therefore, 6 essential elements contribute to a happy society including: 
    <br><br>
    - GDP per capita
    <br>
    - Social Support
    <br>
    - Life Expectancy
    <br>
    - Human Freedom
    <br>
    - Generosity
    <br>
    - Perceptions of Corruption

        After examining <b class = "emphasize">145 countries</b> over the past 4 years, we have observed the trends in various factors that
        contribute to happiness.
        The average happiness score for 2019 is <b class = "emphasize">5.46 out of 10</b> which increased from 5.33 in 2016. Some of the happiest countries tend to 
        locate in North America and Northern Europe regions. Furthermore, There is no one dominant factor that contributes to the happiness of people from around the world; however, social support,
        GDP per capita, and life expectancy are the more important factors according to our analysis, which make us reflect upon what contribute to our overall view of happiness.
